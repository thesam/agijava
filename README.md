# agijava
A clean-room implementation of the AGI interpreter used by Sierra On-Line in the 80s. It is far from complete, but the first rooms in Space Quest 2 are playable.

When I released agijava on Github in 2016, it had not been updated since 2013. As a result, the code is not exactly "state-of-the-art".

Based on the unofficial AGI Specs.
